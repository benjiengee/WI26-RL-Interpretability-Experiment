# WI26-RL-Interpretability-Experiment

My attempt at implementing the VIPER algorithm based on:
- implementation by Pröschel [code](https://github.com/Safe-RL-Team/viper-verifiable-rl-impl/tree/main) 
- **V**erifiability via **I**terative **P**olicy **E**xt**R**action (2019) [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08328) by Bastani et al.

To do so I built a custom ICU Triage environment to highlight the importance of Agent interpretability in high stakes environments.
